Count Data Analysis for Shopping Mall Visits


In this exercise, we will apply regression models for count data, including a Poisson log-linear model and a negative binomial model to analyze a data set on the shopping mall visitation frequencies. The goal is to evaluate whether target marketing is effective in attracting consumers to visit the shopping mall. 

In this data set, "customerID" is for 500 customers who have downloaded and used a mobile app by which the shopping sends target marketing messages. The data track each customer for 50 weeks, so there are 50 observations for each ID. "Visit" is the number of visits to the mall in a week; "Discount" is an index of various discounts offered by the mall; "Target" is a dummy variable which indicates whether a customer receives a targeting message; "Distant" is the distance from the customer's residence to the mall; "Income" is the customer's estimated income and "Gender" is the customer's gender (1 for female)
